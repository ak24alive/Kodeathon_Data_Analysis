We have done trend analysis on three different data sets from real life scenarios. The complexity of the data set and its analysis increases with each data set. The first data set and the simplest one relates to E-commerce purchases. We have identified trends like when the credit cards expire etc. The second data set has been taken from a US Bike Share Company name motivateco. The third one is a big data set from a top movie site. We have done data analysis on it to find the trends like the most like able movies, the most successful movies etc.
